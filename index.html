  <p>Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Sociology department at Harvard. Broadly, I am interested in intergenerational transmission of socio-economic (dis)advantage. My current research projects lie at the intersection of social stratification, demography and applied statistics. In current substantive projects, I aim to integrate causal perspectives on the role of schooling and education in later life outcomes with the more descriptive tradition that has often characterized social mobility research. My ongoing methodological work focuses on causal mediation and interventional effects, with a particular focus on how new statistical approaches can inform substantively important questions in the context of educational inequality.

<b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351191141_How_Social_Class_Influences_Political_Choices">How Social Class Influences Political Choices</a></b>

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('exfelons');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> This chapter examines research from political science, sociology and psychology to understand how and why class position is associated with differences in political attitudes and choices. After reviewing influential definitions of social class, we examine research on explanations of class differences in political behavior. These include class differences in identity, values and self-interest, authoritarianism and control. We then review explanations for changes in political choices between classes over time, focusing on supply-side versus demand-side interpretations of declining levels of class voting in Western democracies, and emphasizing the effects of party programmatic convergence on the political relevance of class-based values. Finally, we assess recent interpretations of the rise of working class support for the radical right political support, pointing to the limitations of status threat accounts, and noting that such political choices are more powerfully associated with educational attainment than with class position. We consider whether this suggests a reconfiguration of electoral behavior from a class-based to an educational divide.

<b><a href="papers/mothers.pdf">Mothers and Mobility: a Re-examination of (Trends in) Intergenerational Mobility in the UK</a></b>

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('exfelons');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> Existing research on intergenerational class mobility typically uses either fathers’ occupa- tion, or the occupation of the ‘class dominant’ parent, as an indicator of ‘class origin’, ignoring heterogeneity in mothers’ and fathers’ class effects on children’s mobility outcomes. Such an elision therefore misses how class reproduction may be shaped by gender in important ways. In this paper, I bring new empirical evidence to the role of mothers in intergenerational mobility in Britain for birth cohorts born in the latter half of the 20th century. I find a significant inde- pendent effect of mothers’ class on individuals’ class destinations, and evidence that fathers’ and mothers’ class positions show a stronger effect on same-gender children. Further, mothers and fathers’ class effects do not show similar trends across cohorts; while fathers’ effects have weakened for women but stayed constant for men, mothers’ effects have weakened for both men and women. My findings highlight the importance of taking a gender-sensitive approach to the study of intergenerational mobility patterns and trends. </div>

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10717">Marginal Interventional Effects</a></b>
(with Xiang Zhou)
<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('covid');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="covid" style="display:none;"><br> Conventional causal estimands, such as the average treatment effect (ATE), reflect how the mean outcome in a population or subpopulation would change if all units received treatment versus control. Real-world policy changes, however, are often incremental, changing the treatment status for only a small segment of the population who are at or near “the margin of participation.” To capture this notion, two parallel lines of inquiry have developed in economics and in statistics and epidemiology that define, identify, and estimate what we call interventional effects. In this article, we bridge these two strands of literature by defining interventional effect (IE) as the per capita effect of a treatment intervention on an outcome of interest, and marginal interventional effect (MIE) as its limit when the size of the intervention approaches zero. The IE and MIE can be viewed as the unconditional counterparts of the policy-relevant treatment effect (PRTE) and marginal PRTE (MPRTE) proposed in the economics literature. However, different from PRTE and MPRTE, IE and MIE are defined without reference to a latent index model, and, as we show, can be identified either under unconfoundedness or through the use of instrumental variables. For both scenarios, we show that MIEs are typically identified without the strong positivity assumption required of the ATE, highlight several “stylized interventions” that may be of particular interest in policy analysis, discuss several parametric and semiparametric estimation strategies, and illustrate the proposed methods with an empirical example.

<b><a href="papers/primary-secondary.pdf">An Interventional Approach to Primary and Secondary Class Effects on Intergenerational Mobility.</a></b>

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('exfelons');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> The theoretical distinction introduced by sociologists of education between primary and sec- ondary class effects on educational outcomes helps researchers disentangle distinct mechanisms underpinning class-based educational inequalities. Research capitalizing on these concepts has, however, been inattentive to the multiple pathways that characterize attainment inequalities, net of demonstrated ability, and further reveals little about the contribution of such effects to intergenerational persistence more broadly. In this paper, I provide a new approach for concep- tualizing primary and secondary effects within a causal framework. I propose two novel types of ‘secondary’ intervention on educational outcomes which map onto two distinct forms of pol- icy intervention designed to break the link between social origin and education. My proposed approach engages with one of the primary contributions of the original theory - namely, the dis- tillation of one mechanism underpinning class educational inequalities particularly amenable to policy intervention - while integrating this framework within the broader research agenda of ed- ucation’s role in intergenerational mobility. Second, I demonstrate how researchers can quantify the impact of these educational interventions on mobility using observational data. I illustrate my approach by showing the utility of distinguishing between these two types of intervention in understanding the sources of intergenerational income persistence using the NLSY97 cohort.

<b> Path-Specific Effects for Monotonic Mediation.</b>
	  (Xiang Zhou)

	  <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('exfelons');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> Identi￿cation and estimation of causal mechanisms is an area that has seen rapid innovation in recent years across the social sciences. Yet, to date, mediation analysis has been implicitly concerned exclusively with settings where levels of the mediator are accessible to all individ- uals, irrespective of their treatment status. Thus, conventional approaches are ill equipped for studying many demographic events, actions and milestones that are characterized by a setup in which each “transition” can be considered “monotonic” in nature. In this article, we introduce a general framework for tracing causal mediation e￿ects in the context of multiple monotonic mediators. Our framework considers the e￿ect of any given demographic transition as operating indirectly, via subsequent transitions, and directly, net of these transitions. We demonstrate that the average treatment e￿ect (ATE) of a transition can be additively decomposed into mutually ex- clusive components that capture these direct and indirect e￿ects. Our proposed decomposition has a number of special properties which distinguish it from conventional decompositions of the ATE via multiple sequential mediators, properties which facilitate less restrictive identi￿cation assumptions as well as identi￿cation of all of the causal paths in the decomposition. We propose both parametric and semiparametric methods for estimating our decomposition, and illustrate the proposed framework using two empirical examples drawn from the education and sociology literature.
