  <p>Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Sociology department at Harvard. My ongoing work focuses on the intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantage and the causal mechanisms underpinning this transmission. In particular, my research aims to integrate causal perspectives on the role of schooling and education in socioeconomic attainment with the more descriptive tradition that has often characterized social mobility research. My current projects focus on the construction of theoretically-informed interventional estimands in the education system that could be used to inform mobility-enhancing policy.

<b><a href="papers/mothers.pdf">Mothers and Mobility: a Re-examination of (Trends in) Intergenerational Mobility in the UK*</a></b>
 <i> Under review.</i> 

<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('exfelons');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="exfelons" style="display:none;"><br> Existing research on intergenerational class mobility typically uses either fathers’ occupa- tion, or the occupation of the ‘class dominant’ parent, as an indicator of ‘class origin’, ignoring heterogeneity in mothers’ and fathers’ class effects on children’s mobility outcomes. Such an elision therefore misses how class reproduction may be shaped by gender in important ways. In this paper, I bring new empirical evidence to the role of mothers in intergenerational mobility in Britain for birth cohorts born in the latter half of the 20th century. I find a significant inde- pendent effect of mothers’ class on individuals’ class destinations, and evidence that fathers’ and mothers’ class positions show a stronger effect on same-gender children. Further, mothers and fathers’ class effects do not show similar trends across cohorts; while fathers’ effects have weakened for women but stayed constant for men, mothers’ effects have weakened for both men and women. My findings highlight the importance of taking a gender-sensitive approach to the study of intergenerational mobility patterns and trends. </div>

<b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10717">Marginal Interventional Effects</a></b>
(with Xiang Zhou)


<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('covid');">[Abstract]</a></i>
<div id="covid" style="display:none;"><br> Conventional causal estimands, such as the average treatment effect (ATE), reflect how the mean outcome in a population or subpopulation would change if all units received treatment versus control. Real-world policy changes, however, are often incremental, changing the treatment status for only a small segment of the population who are at or near “the margin of participation.” To capture this notion, two parallel lines of inquiry have developed in economics and in statistics and epidemiology that define, identify, and estimate what we call interventional effects. In this article, we bridge these two strands of literature by defining interventional effect (IE) as the per capita effect of a treatment intervention on an outcome of interest, and marginal interventional effect (MIE) as its limit when the size of the intervention approaches zero. The IE and MIE can be viewed as the unconditional counterparts of the policy-relevant treatment effect (PRTE) and marginal PRTE (MPRTE) proposed in the economics literature. However, different from PRTE and MPRTE, IE and MIE are defined without reference to a latent index model, and, as we show, can be identified either under unconfoundedness or through the use of instrumental variables. For both scenarios, we show that MIEs are typically identified without the strong positivity assumption required of the ATE, highlight several “stylized interventions” that may be of particular interest in policy analysis, discuss several parametric and semiparametric estimation strategies, and illustrate the proposed methods with an empirical example.
